# X-Team 44 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How will we assign (and reassign) tasks
Make a list of tasks and figure out who wants to do what. If all the tasks are not covered we will take turns doing the tasks
no one specifically wanted to do. 
We will be open to talking about everyones wants and we all know it is okay to be vocal about something that you feel
unconfortable doing by yourself. If anyone needs help with specific task we will add others to help them with it.
 
## How will we track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will check in at specified check-points or when steps are accomplished by individuals. We will let team members know when we move on to new tasks and make sure everybody is on the same page.


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will actively try to communicate with each other and share if we are running into problems with our tasks. 


## How will we back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed



## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
