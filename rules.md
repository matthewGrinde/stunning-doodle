# X-Team 44 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Make a list of tasks and figure out who wants to do what. If all the tasks are not covered we will take turns doing the tasks
no one specifically wanted to do. 
We will be open to talking about everyones wants and we all know it is okay to be vocal about something that you feel
unconfortable doing by yourself. If anyone needs help with specific task we will add others to help them with it.
